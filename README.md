# Backend Implementation of Gmail
Having used Gmail for many years I was always curious to know how it is implemented in the backend. Through this project, I tried to get myself familiar with the actual implementation of Gmail. In this project, I tried to clone Gmail and all of its functions. It starts with creating an actual account and storing its credentials in a binary file. It takes all of the user data that is required to create an account and tries to mimic the actual process. It then goes to the login page where the userâ€™s email and password are validated and the account is accessed. On the homepage of the account, the user can see his/her inbox, outbox and also compose an email. It also gives the option to change the password. In the future, I would like to add more functionality that is provided by Gmail. All the messages are stored in a binary file and can only be accessed through the program. I tried to implement as many OOPs concepts as possible for a better understanding of programming.
